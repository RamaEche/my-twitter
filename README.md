# my-twitter
This is my own recreation of Twitter. This website was made with Vite, React and json-server. It's just a front-end project (this site has no back-end), everything is done on the front-end, so it is NOT safe or good to host for your use. [IT'S JUST A TEST PROJECT]

RECOMMENDATION: to initialize the json server, use the following command "json-server --watch db.json --delay 100".
